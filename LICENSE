The Fork & Trust License (FTL) v1.0

Effective Date: 12/18/2024

1. Purpose and Intent  
This license is intended to:  
1.1 Encourage open, non-commercial research and study of the Licensed Material under a trust-based model.  
1.2 Allow the Original Developer(s) to maintain clear commercial licensing paths.  
1.3 Enable forking, modification, and "checking in" of the code in a version control system only when an appropriate add-on license is obtained, ensuring that all substantial code modifications occur under known and trusted legal terms.

2. Definitions  
2.1 "Licensed Material": The original source code, and any binary distributions derived directly therefrom.  
2.2 "Documentation": Design documents, academic or scientific publications, and supporting materials, licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.  
2.3 "Original Developer(s)": The individual(s) or entity(ies) that first make the Licensed Material available under this License.  
2.4 "Non-Commercial Use": Use of the Licensed Material exclusively for personal, educational, research, or other purposes that do not result in direct or indirect financial gain.  
2.5 "Commercial Use": Any use of the Licensed Material for monetary compensation, profit, or commercial advantage.  
2.6 "Add-On License": A supplementary, no-cost license (for non-commercial activities) or a negotiated commercial license (for commercial activities) obtained from the Original Developer(s) that explicitly permits actions such as forking, modifying, or checking the code into a source control repository.

3. Grant of Rights (Base License)  
3.1 Non-Commercial Viewing and Study: You may, without an Add-On License:  
   (a) Access, read, and study the Licensed Material.  
   (b) Use it non-commercially without creating derivatives or checked-in modifications.

3.2 Documentation: The Documentation is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. You may read, share, and adapt it non-commercially with proper attribution and adherence to the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 terms.

3.3 Trust-Based Assumption:  
   This base license is provided with the understanding that you will respect its terms. For non-commercial experiments or internal research, if you trust the Original Developer(s) to not pursue action against good-faith research activities, you may proceed. However, no right is granted hereunder to fork, modify, or "check in" the code into a version control system without the Add-On License.

4. Add-On License Requirements  
4.1 Non-Commercial Add-On License (Free):  
   For forking, modifying, and checking the Licensed Material into a repository (public or private) for purely non-commercial purposes, you must obtain a complimentary Add-On License from the Original Developer(s). This ensures all code modifications occur under recognized terms, fostering trust and clarity. This Add-On License will be granted upon request at no cost.

4.2 Commercial Add-On License (Negotiated):  
   Any Commercial Use, including but not limited to integrating the Licensed Material into a product, offering it as a service, or otherwise deriving commercial benefit, requires a separate, negotiated Add-On License (a commercial license). Without this commercial Add-On License, no commercial activities are permitted.

4.3 How to Obtain an Add-On License:  
   To request an Add-On License (whether non-commercial or commercial), contact the Original Developer(s) at chloelunastardust@gmail.com. The Original Developer(s) commit to providing the non-commercial Add-On License under reasonable and non-discriminatory conditions, and to discuss commercial terms in good faith.

5. Conditions on Distribution and Modification (Under Add-On License)  
5.1 Attribution and Notices: When modifications are permitted under the Add-On License, all redistributed Modified Versions must:  
   (a) Include this License (and the applicable Add-On License) and a notice of the modifications made.  
   (b) Provide clear attribution to the Original Developer(s).

5.2 No Removal of Notices: You must not remove or alter any copyright or license notices.

5.3 Documentation Handling: Any included Documentation remains under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.

6. Warranty and Liability  
6.1 AS IS: The Licensed Material is provided "as is," without warranties or conditions of any kind.  
6.2 Limitation of Liability: To the extent permitted by law, the Original Developer(s) are not liable for any damages arising from the use or inability to use the Licensed Material.

7. Termination  
7.1 Violations: Any breach of this License or the terms of an Add-On License may lead to termination of your rights.  
7.2 Post-Termination: Upon termination, you must cease using the Licensed Material and any Modified Versions.

8. Governing Law  
This License shall be governed by the laws of New Mexico, and disputes shall be resolved in the courts of New Mexico.

9. Entire Agreement  
This License, together with any Add-On License(s), constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes prior understandings. Modifications require written agreement by the Original Developer(s).

10. Severability  
If any provision is invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect.
