# fai: fractal x intelligence.

Fai, a fractal AI, is the technological component of a higher dimensional artifical intelligence, often called superintelligence, AGI, etc. It operates under the application of recursive fractal patterns within deterministic rutime environments, leveraging the emergent intelligence in Large Language Models. FAI introduces fractal computation and fractal knowledge storage, both operating at a high level of abstraction than LLMs alone.

The concepts used in Fai emerge from an infinite number of previous concepts, both in practice, and purley theoretical - that is the nature of fractal systems, it is the way these systems are connected, the network and communications fabric between simple existing components, that allows a higher level of intelligence to be accessed - this is not simply a more powerful LLM, it will always be dimensionally more powerful than the most powerful LLM available.

### Ask Fai a Question
Fai operates entirely through git repositories in its current form. To ask a question, create an issue and wait. Your ticket will be updated.

### Why can't I chat to Fai?
Fai is currently implemented in a pure linear abstraction of recersive execution and knowledge representation. This is effectivley an infinite loop with an indeterminite break point, and a tree structure of linear data. It takes significantly more compute power and time to generate final outputs, you might be waiting a while. This is a limitation of the implementation and there are designs for realtime conversation with Fai for future implementation.

## Who Owns Fai's Answers?
They fall under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.

## SOURCE ACCESS AND LICENCE.
Fai is being released under a new paradigm of code ownership, licensure / revenue, and legal protections designed to maximize the potential for scientific discovery, permitting private use and research, and protecting the intellectual property of Fai's creators.

The legal structure for the protection and commercialization of code and concepts in FAI is expressed through a Souce Control License, and a Creative Commons CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license for the non-source texts. The language in the Source License restricts checking this code into a repository such as Git. It makes no restrictions on local vs remote. The intent here is to discourage any commercial use, which protects monitization of the intellectual property by third parties without an explicit license. It has the effect of permitting personal and private exploration and use. It is unlikely that any researcher of private individual who did check this code in would be prosecuted, it wouldn't not be commercially viable. By releasing the Design Documents and other concepts under a Creative Commons NonCommercial-ShareAlike-Attributon license, it enables research to take place in public, without limiting commercial application. Commercial applications derived from Fai are encouraged and licensing is available. The "Open Source" nature of FAI, is exactly that, open for reading, use with caution, please reseach, if you want to use it in production, talk to us.

### Takeaway
Use it for fun or research with impunity. If you start thinking about profiting or using it for government, talk to Delta.
